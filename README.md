# CI/CD Test Website

This is a simple HTML website to demonstrate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.

## How it works
- When you push changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site.
- The deployment can be configured to GitHub Pages or any other static hosting provider.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main web page.
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`: The GitHub Actions workflow file (to be created).

## Getting Started
1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
